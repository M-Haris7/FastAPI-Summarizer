Umm Saleh and her family live in central West Bank, but each day they remain in fear of settlers. She explained: “A few days ago, we found them sitting on the swing on our outdoor patio, and they threatened to kill us.”

Her son was injured by settlers this year, and her husband stays home most of the time to act as a deterrent. This has led to a severe financial strain on the family.

Violence by settlers, who are often armed, does not happen in isolation. It is one of multiple occupation-related practices that, combined with other actions, shape a coercive environment. The settlers exert pressure on Palestinians to leave their homes and communities. More than 1,500 Palestinians from the West Bank, most of them children, were displaced in 2023.

Umm Saleh and her family are just one of many families determined to stay. The humanitarian community is doing its part to support such families, with some partners extending legal support, emergency aid or protective presence. However, these efforts are often hampered by limited funding and constraints that make it difficult to provide protection under military occupation.
